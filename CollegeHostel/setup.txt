Template Loading:
If your app includes templates, Django needs to know where to find them. By adding your app to INSTALLED_APPS,
Django knows where to look when resolving template paths.
Static Files:
Similarly, if your app includes static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.), Django uses the INSTALLED_APPS
setting to locate these files when collecting static files during the collectstatic management command.


Migrate helps us to update table which is already created and got data in it.


Fields Attribute:
fields = ['productName', 'productUnit', 'productPrice']: Also inside the Meta class, the fields attribute is set to a
list of field names. These are the fields from the associated Product model that should be
included in the form.



Document Object Model
Javascript can manipulate the current html document.DOM is how we acess various bits of the current screen to read or manipulate
We can find pieces of the model using the id attribute and change them.We can write and read dom from javascript.
The browser is not involved when the javascript is running.The javascript can directly communicate with the models with involving
the routing technology.

Document is the entire page while the window is the part of the page you can view.
AJAX is about loading data in the background and display it on the webpage, without reloading the whole page.
AJAX is the art of exchanging data with a server, and update parts of a web page - without reloading the whole page

Using jquery we are modifying a fully loaded document and if were to take any more data from the model or by route then
the whole document is to be loaded but now using ajax we can route and update a small portion of the document without
loading the entire document.
