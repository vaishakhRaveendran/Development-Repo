Template Loading:
If your app includes templates, Django needs to know where to find them. By adding your app to INSTALLED_APPS,
Django knows where to look when resolving template paths.
Static Files:
Similarly, if your app includes static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.), Django uses the INSTALLED_APPS
setting to locate these files when collecting static files during the collectstatic management command.


Migrate helps us to update table which is already created and got data in it.


Fields Attribute:
fields = ['productName', 'productUnit', 'productPrice']: Also inside the Meta class, the fields attribute is set to a
list of field names. These are the fields from the associated Product model that should be
included in the form.
