React use Document object model for connecting html with javascript.DOM will be implemented by all the browsers.When we load a html page in the browser the javascropt will parse and store the html as a dom object.You can update the dom object by using the dom apis.When we writing in react we dont need to write any html elemennts it will be generated by react inside the div root.We will get acess to global variables react and react-DOM.With browser we will be using DOM and if desktop we could use reactNative.Transpiler will convert jsx file to javascript code.JSX is a syntatic sugar in javasccript language where we can write code in html like stuff for easy going of the developers.We could use babel for transpiling.Javascript can understand react but not jsx.JSX kind of stuff is understood by html. Browser understands javascript.REact allows to do do javascript interpolations.In react we write elements which will be rendered by dom but actually we should write components which contains elements inside it and are reusable.Components are javascript function which returns jsx elements.
Nodejs allows us to run the react outside the browser.



WHAT REACT IS DOING
When we try to build a counter in vanilla javascript.We would have to create a javascript inside the html.Get the button and display objects.Add a event listener to listen to click.Increment the currentstate and display in inner text of display.
But using react it is way easy we would write the html component inside the html element (JSX)and add the listener there iteself.
<Counter /> THis is how you display a compnent inside jsx file.

React hooks are the explicit way of telling react to update the dom if absolutely necessay.Updating dom is very resource intense and react dont want to do this unless asked to do.We will be registering a variable as state in react.
We could use props to individually customise the components.....
