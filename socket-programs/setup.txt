Sockets work on the client and server model.
All the clients are connected to the server and message passing happens between them. When we are playing a game then all the
instances of game happening in the mobile will be identified as client and they are connnected to the local server which
host all the clients. There will be verification and broadcasting in client- server model. Modems will be having internet connection
and routers are wired into the modem and allows other machines to connect modem and have internet. Modems are connected to internet
via satellite dishes or wires connecting to internet towers. Machines can connect to router wirelessly or wired via ethernet.
Each modem will be given a public ip adress which reperesents your physical adress in the internet. You router will assign
a private ip adress to local machines to distinguish them.
