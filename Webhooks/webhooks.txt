Web hooks are event driven and the server will notify us when an event happens via a callback which is a function
or a endpoint. The server will call our callback function without us asking first.We will get notified realtime using
the webhook structure.

You could use a ngrok to create a public ip which could forward the webhooks to a server listening locally...

There are several ways of creating event driven apis
1.Webhooks
2.Websockets
3.Http Streaming
