Express is a minimal node.js framework with higher level of abstraction.Express contain
very robust set of features like complex routing,middlewares,server side rendering and easier handling of request and
 responses.Express allows for rapid development of node.js applications since we don't have to reinvent the wheel.Express
 makes it easier to organize our applications into the mvc architecture

 ### What is an API ###############
 Application Programming Interface is a piece of software that can be used by another piece of software  in order to
 allow applications to talk to each other..
 Rest api means representational state transfer apis.There is a procedure for creating rest apis.
 1.Separate API into logical resources.
 All the data we want to share should be divided into logical resources
 Resource is an object or representation of something which has data associated with it.
 Any information can be named as a resource.Eg user,tours,reviews.

 2.These resources should be exposed as resource based urls.
 /getTour,/updateTour,/deleteTour


 3.To perform various actions on the data like creation,deletion and updation the apis should write
 http methods and not urls.We should only have resources as end and not the action.The action should be
 referred via the http methods. The verb will be in the http method.

  /getTour--> get /tours
  /updateTour --> put /tours  or   patch /tours
  while using put the client have to send the entire data while with patch you only have to send the
  updated portion
  /addNewTour ---> post /tours
  /deleteTour ----> delete /tours
  /getToursByUser ---> get /users/3/tours

  These allows to user to perform the basic crud operations....

 4.Send data as json and rest apis should be stateless..
 Json is a lightweight data exchange format using for web applications.
 Stateless means a request must contain all the necessary information to process a client request.The server
 does not have to remember previous request.State refers to peice of information in application which could
 change over time.Eg of state:LoggedIn,currentPage.

 What are middle wares and express request-response cycle..
 A request and response object is created for every request express receives from the user.These are processed to send back a
 meaningful response to the user.To process the info we use something called middle ware which is capable of manipulating the response
 and request object.The order of code is vey important in express since it determines the order in middleware stack.WE move to
 the next middleware in the stack by calling the next() method.
